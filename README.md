# Power-Bi
Show casing Power BI project
Hello guys, I am happy to share that I have completed Business Insights 360 project which is part of Codebasics Power BI Data Analytics Course.

In this project, I have built an dashboard for the Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply chain teams at a hypothetical company called AtliQ Hardware, to help them analyze the data effectively for better decision-making.

I have used Power BI for gathering insights and deriving patterns from a dataset containing 4 million transaction records

Problem Statement:

Previously AtliQ was doing analysis in Microsoft Excel itself but now the company has expanded its operations in different regions and has a large amount of data to perform analysis and to take data-driven business decisions.

So, the product owner of the company wants the analytics team to make a dashboard to track all of the important key metrics from different departments and generate useful insights from the raw data.

Solution:

As a Data Analyst, I have created a report using Power BI. I have created 5 different dashboards in this report and 1 User Friendly Homepage to easily Navigate to the Pages as they wish. 4 for individual departments and 1 dashboard for the Executives to track different KPIs from all the departments to get an overview of the business performance and overall health of the business.

Tools Used :
SQL
Power BI Desktop
Excel
DAX language
DAX studio (for optimizing the report)

While working on this project I have learned :
DAX functions -
CALCULATE ( )
DIVIDE ( )
FILTER ( )
SWITCH ( )
Data cleaning & ETL from Power Query,
Data Modelling,
Data Validation,
Performance Optimization,
Adding a Personal Gateway for Automatic Data Refresh, etc.

Importing Data to Power BI:
As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from MYSQL database to Power BI by providing the Database access credentials.

Dashboard design:

Based on the mock ups received as requirement, designed the visuals and created Important measures as and when required.
